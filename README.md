### Project Title
Enhancing E-Commerce Performance through Data-Driven UX Optimization

### PROJECT SUMMARY
This project analyses user behavior within the FlexTrade e-commerce app to identify issues affecting user engagement and sales performance.
Using data analytics, I provided actionable insights that led to significant improvements in app usability, customer satisfaction, and conversion rates.

### BUSINESS PROBLEM
**Despite high download and usage rates, FlexTrade experienced:**

- High Bounce Rate: 45% of users left after minimal interaction
- Cart Abandonment: 30% of users exited with items still in cart
- Low Average Order Value: Below industry benchmarks
- Intense Competition: In a saturated online shopping market

### DATA SOURCE
For this project, data were retrieved from:
- Bounce rates, session lengths, conversion funnel drop-offs
- User Behaviour Logs: Number of page views, time spent, cart interactions
- Feedback Dataset: User reviews, complaints, and suggestions
- Order Value Records: Order frequency and spend amount per user

### Key Findings of the project
- A large proportion of users exited the app after minimal engagement amounted to a 45% Bounce Rate (<5 page views).
- Users added items to their cart but exited before purchase. This amounted to 30% Cart Abandonment: 
- The average customer spent less than the industry benchmark (Low AOV).
- 90+ Feedback Entries: Common complaints included buggy checkout, missing promo codes, and long loading times.
- Session Duration Insight: Users with session times >10 minutes were 3x more likely to convert.

### Recommendations given are:
- Resolve recurring bugs in the checkout and cart functions.
- Remove redundant steps and introduce one-click purchase options.
- Display related products based on user views and past behaviour.
- Introduce limited-time offers or bundles based on cart contents.
- Use session time and cart value thresholds to trigger incentives (e.g., free shipping).

### Impact on the Business
Following the implementation of my data-driven recommendations:
- Bounce rate dropped significantly from 45% to under 30%, indicating improved user engagement and retention.
- Cart abandonment rate decreased from 30% to below 20%, reflecting a more streamlined and user-friendly checkout process.
- Conversion rate increased by 18%, demonstrating the effectiveness of personalised recommendations
  and session-based incentives in turning visits into purchases.
These insights and recommendations enabled the company to optimise user flow, improve app satisfaction,
and ultimately increase revenue per user session.

This project clearly demonstrates how data analytics can transform user experience, streamline operations, 
and increase profitability in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
It also showcases my ability to:
- Conduct deep-dive analytical investigations
- Translate data into actionable business strategies
- Communicate insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

**Skills Demonstrated for this project are:** 
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- User Segmentation
- Dashboard Reporting
