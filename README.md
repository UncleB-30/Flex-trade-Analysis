### Project Title
Enhancing E-Commerce Performance through Data-Driven UX Optimization

### PROJECT SUMMARY
This project analyses user behavior within the FlexTrade e-commerce app to identify issues affecting user engagement and sales performance.
Using data analytics, I provided actionable insights that led to significant improvements in app usability, customer satisfaction, and conversion rates.

### BUSINESS PROBLEM
**Despite high download and usage rates, FlexTrade experienced:**

- High Bounce Rate: 45% of users left after minimal interaction
- Cart Abandonment: 30% of users exited with items still in cart
- Low Average Order Value: Below industry benchmarks
- Intense Competition: In a saturated online shopping market

DATA SOURCE
App Analytics (Bounce rate, session time, funnel drop-offs)

### Formulas
``` Total sales
= Sum ( A4:D4)
```
